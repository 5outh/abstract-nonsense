## 12/12/2016 (Venice)

Today we finished up the longest flight of my life! 12 hours to Paris, then 2
more into Venice with hardly any rest. We made our way to the hotel via a bus ride
and a water bus (vaporetto) ride through the Grand Canal. Fewer people speak English
than we expected, but we're getting by. Our B&B hosts are all really nice, and gave us
food recommendations and a walking route to get a feel for the city. After crashing for
about an hour in the hotel room, we ate at one of the recommended places. I 
accidentally ordered something with nuts, so Amanda and I ended up having to
switch dishes. Oops! Otherwise, it was pretty good! After lunch, we set off on the recommended
walking route, which took us through San Marco, the Accademia district, Dorsoduro, over
the Rialto bridge and back to our hotel. Very pretty and maze-like with lots of interesting shops
along the way. We stopped briefly for some capuccinos at a cafe, and later on had some gelato for
dinner (!). Heading in for an early night (like 6:00 PM) because we are both exhausted.


## 12/13/2016 (Venice)

We slept like babies! And breakfast at Dimora Marciana was so good! Excellent capuccinos and
a variety of pastries, meats, cheeses and croissants. After breakfast, we set out for
Piazza San Marco with an audio tour we'd downloaded onto our phones. This was a good idea,
because it pointed out a lot of interesting subtle details about the piazza that we wouldn't
have noticed otherwise. For example, the surrounding buildings are built with three completely
separate styles of column, because the floors were built in different eras. Visual stories
are also told on the columns beneath Doge's Palace (the dwelling place of the historic ruler of
Venice) - very cool. After the audio tour, we went into Doge's Palace, which has been turned into
a museum. Every ceiling is painted beautifully; it's incredible. The transition from the palace
to the jails (over the Bridge of Sighs) is a surreal experience. It's a weird couple of steps from
gilded halls to drab, thick stone walls and plain prison cells. When we were done, we walked around
town a little and found a place to eat. I had seafood risotto (with lots of seafood I'd never seen
before!) and Amanda had some seafood pasta. Both were delicious. We took an afternoon break and waited
for a vegetarian place to open for dinner - it was really dark and creepy, and hard to find, and they
were booked! Huge bummer, but we went to a place called Tuttinpietti instead for some
pasta, which we ate in our room. It was great anyway, so whatever. Afterwards, we set out for a gelato
place called SuSo, determined to mark off a win for the night. We got super lost, and by the time we found
it, it was closed! Agh! We went back to our rooms, tired and gelato-less, ate some chocolate raisins
for dessert and went to bed. Oh well! Dessert before dinner tomorrow!

## 12/14/2016 (Venice)

We had planned to tour the islands (Murano and Burano) today, but woke up groggy and postponed.
Instead, we looked into touring Peggy Guggenheim's old house-turned-museum. It was a very interesting
place with exciting exhibits of modern art. Also, Gwendoline Christie (Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones)
was there with us! Crazy! After the tour, we wandered around the Accademia district and made our way all the way
to "the point" at the end of the island. After a mediocre lunch at a touristy place, we rested for a bit. A
little later on, we went to a place called I Tre Mercanti for some tiramisu (dessert before dinner!). Acqua Alta
Libraria was in the same part of town, so we checked it out. This place must have been the coolest book store
on the planet. The building is full of books from floor to ceiling, piled on tables and old gondolas. We grabbed
a couple of Christmas gifts here and headed back to the hotel room, still very tired from jet lag and the last
few days. Looking forward to the Murano/Burano trip tomorrow!

## 12/15/2016 (Murano, Burano)

We got a good night's rest last night and headed out to get on a boat to Burano island late in the morning. The
walk was nice - the area near Fondamente Nove (the water bus station) was relaxed. We hopped on a water bus and
passed a few islands - a walled city, and Murano, the glass blowing island. The travel time to Burano was pretty
long (about 50 minutes) but we eventually made it to the island of lace and colorful houses! It was kind of like
a very-tiny Venice with a small fraction of the population. We sought out the lace museum, which was a disappointment,
but only 5 euros each, so whatever. We expected to spend more time there, so we had some downtime for a coffee at
a local bar before our lunch reservation. We also walked around the island for a while, saw the leaning clock tower,
and relaxed by the seaside. Lunch was intense. We went to a place called Gatto Nero and both had a portion of 
seafood spaghetti; it was the most involved meal I've ever eaten, with several shellfish and other seafood. It was
super tasty. The second course was a plate of seafood fritto misto. Some of that was good and some of it wasn't. The
best part of the plate was fried salted cod. We split a bottle of tasty white wine with this meal, too, then capped
off the 2 hour long lunch with a shot of espresso. It was getting late in the day at this point, but we wanted to see
Murano, so we got on the next water taxi and headed that way. We browsed a couple of shops here and picked up some
glass creations. The glass here was stunning; I wish we'd been able to stay a bit longer, but it was really late. When
we got back to mainland Venice, we stopped by a shop for a hot chocolate dessert. Something from the day ended up making
Amanda sick that night, unfortunately. :(

## 12/16/2016 (Venice)

A day of rest! Mandy needed some recovery time from yesterday so we didn't do a whole lot. We did get some delicious fresh
pasta from a place called Dal Moro's, though. I spent a bit of the day planning for what to do in Florence. We rallied
a little later to go grab a slice of pizza for dinner at Antico Forno. Venice was much busier on a Friday night, and there
was even a (very good!) violinist playing music in one of the squares. The pizza, and the walk, was really nice. A great way
to end our time in Venice.

## 12/19/2016 (Venice/Florence)

Woops it's been a few hectic days since the last entry!

### 12/17/2016 (Venice/Florence)

This was the day we left Venice. We walked up to Rialto Bridge with our packed luggage and took a water bus up to the train
station. It was a beautiful day, so we sat in front, on the exterior of the boat. This is maybe my favorite part about Venice -
boating down the Grand Canal is absolutely stunning! Once we made it to the train station, we had to gather our bearings. Neither of us
had ever ridden on an EU train (or any train?) before, so we weren't sure of what to do. We eventually found our train and our seats
and settled in. Well, so we thought - we were wrong! At the second stop, some Italian women kicked us out of our seats and we moved to
the proper section of the train. After that minor speedbump, the ride was comfortable and quick. The destination train station in Florence
really overwhelming, though. We searched around everywhere for a bathroom in a huge crowd and had to ask a few people how to find the
bus we were looking for. It all worked out, but there were thousands of people in the station and our bus came really late. Eventually
it did come, and after a 20 minute bus ride, we arrived at our destination - the base of the hil our hotel sat on. Trudging up the hill
with our heavy luggage was *so hard* after such an exhausting day, but finally arriving at the hotel was a huge relief. We got a brief
tour of the grounds and crashed for a little while. We had booked a wine tour for that night, though, so we couldn't relax for too long!
We were also starving after traveling with no lunch and were desperate to eat. So, we had our hotel's shuttle drive us into Florence
and we found a place to eat (hot pots with dumplings; not that good!) and made our way to Ponte Vecchio afterwards. Ponte Vecchio
is the first bridge in Florence, and the meetup point for the start of our wine tour. Turns out, we were the only ones who booked
the tour, so we got a surprise private wine tour! We got some little wine glasses to carry around town and were shown some interesting
land marks (mostly little historic things about the city). As for wine, we tasted 5 kinds and ate some crostini. The most interesting
story was the one about the "black rooster" Chianti. We ended the tour at the duomo - a huge, beautiful, green and white church that
took 150 years to complete! Then we got picked up by our hotel shuttle and crashed hard.

### 12/18/2016 (Florence)

This was our food tour day, so we woke up extra early to meet with the tour guide at 9:30! We ate a tiny bite to eat at the hotel so
we would be hungry for the tour and got the earliest shuttle ride possible to meet up in time. Only, once we got there, we suddenly
realized...nobody else was there. We had done all that and we had shown up for the tour on the wrong day! Major oops! After kicking
ourselves for messing up so badly, we decided to make the most of the day anyway. We headed to the Uffizi gallery first. Wow, that
museum is huge! There were a ton of paintings and statues - just the amount of art in one place was impressive. The best parts were
the few Da Vinci and Michelangelo paintings. I didn't get a picture, but I also loved the shield with medusa's head painted on it.
We found a little sandwich shop called Antico Noe and had some roast beef paninis on a little back road afterwards (we were *starving*!
we were expecting a food tour!). Afterwards, we found a little pastry shop and split a chocolate ganache tart with some coffee. Afterwards,
we wandered around looking for the Christmas market. We thought we found it, but what we found was actually a tiny little market square.
Eventually, we wandered into the real chirstmas market, which is significantly bigger, in a large square. It's mostly German food and things
and knock-off looking clothes. A little underwhelming.

We still had half a day left, so we decided to visit the Boboli Gardens. Holy cow, that place is *massive*! And beautiful, too! We saw
a man feeding some ducks and pigeons in a pond, and a happy kid playing with the pigeons - a couple of nice, memorable moments. Along with
the Boboli Gardens ticket, we got access to a costume museum, which we visited after exhausting ourselves in the gardens. The old clothing
was neat. Afterwards, we popped into a pastry shop for a cannoli - Amanda had been looking for a good one. We split it and it was really
good! Wish we'd have gotten two. For dinner, Mandy was feeling a little homesick and found some American place called The Diner. It was weird
to see a depiction of US culture in Italy - they had paintings on desegregation and fat people on the walls! I had some particularly odd
chicken soup and Amanda ate a burger and fries. The burger wasn't bad! Not long after we ate, we got picked up and went to bed around 8 PM.
This was one of the most exhausting days of my life.
 
### 12/19/2016 (Florence)

We slept well last night. We had to get up early today to catch the *real* food tour, which was rough but we managed. We ate a little
more this morning than yesterday, and headed out to our first stop - a butcher! There were wild boar heads on the wall, sausages hanging
from the ceiling, and tons of prosciuttos curing on the walls. It was like nothing I've ever seen before. There were seven of us on the tour -
four from Wisconson and one other guy from Suwanee, GA (where I grew up)! Small world! Everyone was really nice, including our amazing tour
guide, Martina. We started off by tasting a few prosciuttos, one cured with only salt and one with black pepper added. We went to a bakery
next. Bakeries in Italy only bake savory foods. We had some coccoli (a bread donut thing) with mozzarella and tomato here. The next stop was
the big one - the central market - a giant, two story farmer's market. We ate some sandwiches with boiled brisket on the bottom floor and took
a short break for some coffee and shopping upstairs. After the break, we hit up a pastry shop for some cream puffs (very big ones, fried) and
headed to an enoteca - a wine bar - to have some crostini and wine. This place was small but packed full of wine, oil, balsamic vinegar and
a variety of cheeses for sale. Here I learned that real balsamic vinegar is incredible, but expensive. It costs 90 euros for a small bottle,
fermented and bottled by the Moderna government. Olive oil in Italy also has a much stronger flavor, which is quite nice. All of the crostini
and appetizer-type things we ate were good as well, except the "special treat" of a liver-based topping, which I didn't like. The wines we 
tasted here were good, but the real stars of this stop were the oil and vinegar, surprisingly! The last top on the tour was a chocolate shop
called Vestri. The family who owns this place controls every step of the chocolate production, from the cacao farm to finished chocolate. The
chocolate was some of the best we've ever had; I tried a sipping chocolate "shot" with some anice liqueur. Yum. We then parted ways. I highly
recommend doing one of these food tours in Florence; it was probably my favorite part of the whole trip.

We had two hours before our shuttle was scheduled to pick us up, so we dediced to check out the Musei Galilei before heading back to the hotel.
This was a very interesting museum, containing lots of old scientific tools. One of the most impressive was a three dimensional "map of the
universe" that took 5 years to complete. Lots of other hidden treasures in here as well. I'm glad we went; it was a nice break from art museums!
Afterwards, we waited for our shuttle for 15 minutes before realizing...they weren't coming. We had to find a phone to use to call the hotel.
Eventually, we came across another hotel and asked the concierge (named Eliza) to help us out. She got a hold of the shuttle and we were able
to get picked up soon after. We were stranded for a minute, though! At this point, we rested for a few hours before heading down to San Miniaio
Square for dinner. We ate pizza. It was lovely. It's supposed to rain tomorrow but we're going to try to see David and finish our Christmas
shopping. Other than that, we'll try to relax and get ready for the trip home.

## 12/20/2016 (Florence)

We did get some relaxation in today! Breakfast was good, but Amanda tried to get by on cheese and honey (a weird choice). We slept in a bit
and headed out of the hotel around 10:00. We immediately headed towards the Accademia Gallery, where David is located. After waiting in a line
for about 20 minutes, we made it in. The museum isn't very big; it's just a single corridor and a few rooms. The main attraction really is 
David. It is hugely impressive, though. We both found the full-size statue remarkable. We spent probably 20 minutes there, staring at the
giant statue and browsing some of Michaelangelo's unfinished sculptures. Afterwards, it was shopping day! First, we found a reputable leather
shop (Michaelangelo's) and got Amanda a new purse. This place was in the market square, so we picked up some veggie samosas from a hole in the
wall for lunch while we were in the area. The next stop was the huge central market for food-related gifts! Here, we got some cheese, oil, 
vinegar and coffee for our friends and family. We also caved and bought some traditional balsamic vinegar for ourselves. The last stop we made
was at Massimo Ravinale for some silk; the man who helped us out was notably very helpful. After a quick last-minute cannoli, we went back to
the hotel and packed some stuff up. And binge watched Please Like Me (it's on Netflix here). It was a nice stretch of relaxation we'd been
needing. At 7:30, we went to dinner at a place called Zeb, which was recommended by our food tour guide. We had two types of ravioli (pear and
butternut squash), a peppery beef stew called peposo, a few glasses of wine and a salted chocolate torte. It was the best meal we had in Italy.
A perfect way to end our trip to Florence! We leave in the morning (at 5:00 AM) and will really miss it here. The whole experience was
unforgettable!
