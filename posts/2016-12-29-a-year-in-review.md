# Things I learned

###  A lot about Stripe and billing

Two of my major projects for work this year revolved around billing. Knowing Stripe's APIs
and how internet payment works was crucial, so I learned a bunch about it.

### Frontend development

I was put in a purely frontend position for a portion of this year, so I learned a good
amount about our stack (React, Redux) and general web weirdness
like [z-index stacking order](https://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/).
Frontend work isn't my favorite but it's interesting enough! 

###  How to Learn

I took a [Coursera course on learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).
I recommend it!

### Baking & Cooking 

I baked a bunch of savory stuff this year and have an active sourdough starter in my fridge. I love it!
I also practiced cooking and made some new things this year, like coconut curry.

# Things I read 

I didn't read as much as I'd have liked this year, but that's okay. Pretty much everything I read was nonfiction.

- [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/) (partly) - Steven W. Smith
- [Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007SGLZH6) - Ken Forkish
- [Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/) (partly) - Christpher Allen & Julie Moronuki 
- [Spelunky](https://bossfightbooks.com/products/spelunky-by-derek-yu) - Derek Yu
- [Tartine Bread](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F8H0FNW/) - Chad Robertson
- [A bunch of Julie Evans' Zines](https://jvns.ca/)

I loved Flour, Water, Salt Yeast. I was making bread really soon after reading through it and Ken's story is great.
I love Spelunky (the game), and hearing about the design process behind it was even more insightful than I expected;
I recommend this book to anyone who does anything creative. It was motivating for me as an artist and programmer and
has lots of little insights that make it worth the short read. Julie Evans' zines kick ass! They pop up in my twitter
feed every now and then and I can't get enough. I always come away from them having learned something new after only
a couple of minutes and that makes them so worthwhile to check out.

# Travel

Holy cow, I didn't realize how much traveling I did this year!

### Utah with Seller Labs, Snowboarding

We went on a trip to Ogden, Utah as a company and spent a few days up in a cabin at night, snowboarding
at Snowbasin during the day. Really, really fun experience and the mountains in the winter are beautiful.

### LambdaConf in Boulder, CO

I went to one conference this year - LambdaConf. Boulder was beautiful and I loved meeting people at
the conference. Went with a few coworkers and we all had a blast.

### San Francisco/ Wine Country with Amanda and Eleanor

I'd never been out to San Francisco, and my wife's friend lives out there, so we were able to stay with
her (thanks Eleanor!). We mixed up the trip by going to Sonoma one day, and doing a horseback ride through
half moon bay. Loved this trip.

### Honeymoon in Venice and Florence, Italy

My first trip to Europe!

# Programming/Work 

Work was productive this year. I helped launch two separate applications and revamped the billing structure of
an existing one. I decimated a lot of legacy code. I started using vim. I pair (and mob) programmed a lot! I
mainly wrote Haskell, Elm, Javascript and PHP for work. I also did a lot of non-programming stuff - in particular,
I got pretty good at interviewing developers.

# Writing and talking

I wrote two blog posts for this blog over the course of this year. More excitingly, Stack Overflow's hiring blog
contacted me to write a guest post on their site about my interviewing strategy!

I gave two separate talks this year. One was an in-company thing about digital signal processing basics, based off
of what I learned from my book. The other was a more involved bit on how math is like art, and programming is like
math and art, and we should all try out the creative side of computing. I really enjoyed giving that talk and
hope to pitch it to a conference or two next year. I also submitted a talk to LambdaConf on dynamically generating
drum beats with my open-source library Bang, but it was rejected. At least I tried!

I also stepped up my community game this year by taking co-organizership of the Athens, GA software developer's
meetup group along with a couple other guys. I've met a lot of people this way and, more than anything, it's
gotten me out to all of the meetups and talks. I've enjoyed the experience a lot!

# Open Source

I wrote a couple of small things this year. Nothing major, just a few experiements and stuff.

- determination - An undertale-inspired command line utility.
- jank - a little CLI JSON processor.
- talking metronome - counts "one two three four" etc.
- haskellplz - Tiny thing that stubs out haskell modules for you and places them in the right directory.

`jank` and the metronome were experiments in consiceness. I wanted to defer as much as possible to existing
utilities. `jank` is mainly `lens-aeson` wrapped in a thin CLI layer. The `metronome` uses the `say` utility on OS X
and just loops over a set of words at a certain rate. It has been extremely useful for drum practice. 

# Games 

- **Carcasonne** - Classic, still playing this a lot.
- **Happy Salmon** - A really fun, interactive party game that will make you lose your voice!
- **Captain Sonar** - 8-player real-time battleship simulator. Tense and amazing.
- **Patchwork** - 2-player game about quilts and buttons with a surprising amount of strategy. My wife and I have
played a lot of this recently and love it.
- **Pandemic: Legacy**

I played through **Pandemic: Legacy** with my wife and a couple of friends (Alex & Shannon). It's a spinoff of Pandemic
that you play through over the course of 12 to 24 games, making up a "year of pandemic." The game changes
_permanently_ with every game you play; the characters, the board, the rules, and the objectives are always
being modified! We met every Friday for a few months and had an absolute blast. I recommend this if you can put
together a static group of 4 players who all enjoy Pandemic.
